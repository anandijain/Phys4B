Solid dialectric sphere raidus b of charge -2Q with a point charge at center +Q

There is a concentric hollow of radius a in the solid.

Find the point where E = 0 

## soln

The key takeaway is that we need to exploit the fact that if E is radial and we have a spherical charge distribution and GS then if qnet = 0 then E = 0 

Do the 3 step checklist to show that Eout is zero so that the E is all due to enclosed charge 

Then we can do 

Flux I = closed int dot(Evec, dAvec) = qenc/eps
    closed int E * dA cos 0 = Q + rho * Vol 

This invokes a subproblem to find the rho * Vol that causes the sum with Q to be 0. 
This is the bulk of the problem to find the radius for the GS that has 0 net encolsed charge.
