# Problem 2.31
(a) Three charges are situated at the corners of a square (side a), as shown in
Fig. 2.41. How much work does it take to bring in another charge, +q, from far away and place it in the fourth corner?

(b) How much work does it take to assemble the whole configuration of four charges?

(a)
q1 = (q, [0,0])
q2 = (-q, [0,a])
q3 = (-q, [a,0])

what is the work required to bring a charge q4 = (q) to [a,a]

we can use the fact that the potential due to a point charge is 

k q / r. 

so r(1->P) = a sqrt(2)
r(2->P) = a
r(3->P) = a

so we get (k q / (a rt(2)) - 2 k q / a) * q  = W

simplified 

W = k q2( (sqrt(2) - 4)/2a)

(b)
