7. Consider two conducting parallel infinite flat plates of equal charge density but opposite sign
(e.g. a charged capacitor). Let the plates be separated by a distance d. Let the left plate be at the
origin (x = 0) in the z-y plane and be defined to be the zero potential. Find the potential of the
right plate. Find the potential as a function of x within the three regions of space that involve this
configuration of charge.

first quick and dirty gauss law on the inf sheet
the plates have cd sig and -sig
gauss cyl rad r len l then qenc = sig pi r2

flux 
by the symm of the plate, E is perp to the plate itself everywhere and then 
for our GS the magnitude will be constant since the distance away from plate is fixed. again bc symm of plate 
caps have theta = 0 so we can evaluate dot product
closed int E dot dA = sig pi r2 / eps 
    = int cap1 + int cap2 + int side = ... | flux int side -> 0 since perp
    = int E dA cos 0  + int E dA cos 0 
    = 2 E A 
    = E 2 pi r2 = sig pi r2 / eps 
E = sig / 2 eps 

one thing to note though, since the sheet is described by x = 0 
(sheet 2 is x = d)
then Evec = sig/2eps * sign(x) ihat
sheet two Evec2 = -sig/2eps * sign(x-d) ihat
we can see then that in the middle where x in (0, d)
E = Evec + Evec2 (POS)
    = sig/2eps ihat + -sig/2eps * -1 ihat
    = sig/eps ihat

now we have the efield in between the plates, now line integral

V = -int (0, d) sig/eps ihat dot dx ihat | vectors parallel, eval `dot`
    = -sig/eps int(0,d) dx 
    = -sig/eps [x @ (0,d)] => d - 0
    = -sig d / eps

sign makes sense because E points in the direction of decreasing potential and x=0 is V=0

part (b) finding for 1) x < 0 2) x in (0, d) and 3) x > d is just E = Evec + Evec2 (POS)
