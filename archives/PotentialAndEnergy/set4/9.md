9. Four identical particles, each of charge q and mass m are released from rest at the vertices of a
square of side L. How fast is each particle moving when their distance from the center of the square
doubles?

# soln (try 1, wrong)
have q1 be bottom right
notice that KEi all 0 and no ext forces so W =0
W = DU sys = q1 q2 q3 q4.
0 = DKEs + DUE
    = sum(KEfs) + DUEs 

lets solve for one of the particles change in potential energy 

the potential due to the other three charges initially:

notice the geometry when the distance to center of square doubles also means that the side length doubles 

UE1i = q V 
    q(2kq/L + kq/(L sqrt(2)))

UE1f = q V
    = q(2 k q/ 2L + k q / (L 2 sqrt (2)))

the delta is UE1f - UE1i
= -k q2 / L * (1 + 1/(2 sqrt(2)))

by symmetry the other 3 will ahve the same delta and same change in kinetic so we can solve for a single particle

k q2 / L * (1 + 1/(2 sqrt(2))) = 1/2 m vf2 

then solve for vf

WRONG
# try 2 

recall that potential of a sys is a quantity of the whole config 
so UEi cant be split up how i did above we need to compute everything 

there are 4 side lenght interactions and 2 diagonal

UEi = 4kq2/L + 2kq2/(L sqrt(2))
UEf = 4kq2/2L + 2kq2/(2 L sqrt(2))
    = 2kq2/L + kq2/(L sqrt(2))

delta UE = UEf-UEi
    = 2kq2/L + kq2/(L sqrt(2)) - (4kq2/L + 2kq2/(L sqrt(2)))
    = -2kq2/L - kq2/(L sqrt(2))

now by symmetry a single particle at final will have KE = 1/2 m v2
so the total change in KE is 2 m v2 (multiplying by 4 )
2 m v2 = 2kq2/L + kq2/(L sqrt(2))
v = sqrt((2kq2/L + kq2/(L sqrt(2))/2m))
