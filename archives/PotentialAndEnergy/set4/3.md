3. Charges +Q1 and –Q2 are held fixed from one another by a distance of d. Find the work done
by an external applied force to move a –q from a distance d outside the negative charge (along a
line joining the two fixed charges) to a point directly in between the two fixed charges without
changing the kinetic energy of the cha rge, -q.


# soln
q1 = (Q1, [0])
q2 = (-Q2, [d])
q3 = (-q, [2d])

W = Delta U | sys = {q1,q2,q3}
    = DKEs + D UEs | DKEs 0 since all unchanged
    = D_UE(1->3) + D_UE(2->3)
    = kQ1(-q)/(d/2) - kQ1(-q)/2d + k(-Q2)(-q)/(d/2) - k(-Q2)(-q)/d
    algebra
W = kq/d(-3/2 Q1 + Q2)
