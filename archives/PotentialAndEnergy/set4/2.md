# Prob 2

Q = Sphere[R, Q]
q = ChargedMass(q,m) infinitely far away  

Find the initial velocity of q such that the charge "just" touches Q 

There are two ways to solve. 
confusions 
F_el is external, how do we know if we need to make the bounds (inf, R) or (R, inf). do we ever put cos pi as the angle if the force is antiparallel the displacement? (i dont think so)

# Sys = q 

Try one (BAD)
```
W = Delta U sys = {q}
W_me = Delta KE 
W_me = KE_f - KE_i | KE_f = 0 by "just" in problem statement
W_me = - KE_i
    = - 1/2 m vi2
W_me = int(inf, R) F_me dot dr rhat 
    = -int(inf, R) F_el dot dr rhat
    = int(R, inf) F_el dot dr rhat
    = int(R, inf) k Q q / r2 rhat dot dr rhat 
    = int(R, inf) k Q q / r2 dr cos 0 
    = k Q q int(R, inf) dr / r2 
    = k Q q [-1/r @ (R, inf)] => (1/inf - -1/R)
    = k Q q / R
```

The work that I have to do to bring the charge q to distance R away from the nucleus is k Q q / R

k Q q / R = - 1/2 m vi2

# sys = q Try 2 

If the system is q, then the electric force F(Q->q) is external and will be doing work on the system, since its force through a  displacement. 

The limits of integration follow the actual path of motion of the system so (inf, R)

The work we are trying to calculate is the net external.
Usually we use W_me since "I" am usually external, and in the classic problem of the work to move a same polarized charge to a distance away from a fixed q I am counteracting the F_el.

Here Fel is the "me" ie external.

Delta U = Delta KE since potential is only defined between pairs of charges, so there is no potential energy in the system as defined

W = Delta U (sys = q)
int(inf, R) F_el dot dr rhat = delta KE 
int(inf, R) k Q q / r2 rhat dot dr rhat = KEf - KEi | KEf=0 by "just"
k Q q int(inf,R) 1/r2 dr cos 0 = - KEi
k Q q [-1/r @ (inf, R)] => (-1/R - -1/inf)
-k Q q / R = -1/2 m vi2
vi = sqrt(2 k Q q / (m R))


# sys = {Q, q}
W = Delta U sys = {Q, q} | there is no net external work done because even though there is a net external force holding Q in place, it is through 0 displacement, thus no work

0 = Delta KEQ + Delta KEq + Delta UE | Q fixed so Delta KE = 0
    = KEf - KEi + UEf - UEi | "just" => KEf =0
    = -KEi + k Q q / R - k Q q / inf | k Q q / inf is zero 
KEi = k Q q / R
1/2 m vi2 = k Q q / R
algebra
vi = sqrt(2 k Q q / (m R))
