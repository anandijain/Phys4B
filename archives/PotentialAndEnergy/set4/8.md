8. Consider a uniformly charged dielectric sphere of radius R and total charge Q. Let the zero
potential be defined at the surface of the sphere. Find the potential of the sphere at its center.

steps:
1) gauss law to find E(r) where r < R
2) line integral

1) gl 
rho = Q / (4/3 pi R3)
want to find E(r) for r < R 
qenc = rho * 4/3 pi r3 
    = 4/3 pi r3 * Q / (4/3 pi R3)
    = Q r3 / R3 

cint E dot dA = Q r3 / (R3 eps) | e radial + r const for GSphere
E cint dA = ..
E 4 pi r2 = Q r3 / R3
E = k Q r / R3

2) line integral

V = -int(R, 0) E dot dl 
    = -int(R, 0) k Q r / R3 rhat dot dr rhat | vecs align => eval dot
    = -k Q / R3 int(R,0) r dr 
    = - k Q / R3 [r2/2 @ (R,0)] => 0 - R2/2
    = k Q / (2 R) 

sign makes sense sense the Efield is pointing to lower potential (which is radial)

thus the center should be higher potential
