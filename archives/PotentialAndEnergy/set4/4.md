4. Three equal charges of equal mass are held fixed forming an equilateral triangle. Two of the
three are released while the third is held fixed. Find the speed of one of the released charges
when it is infinitely far away. Do this problem using energy methods with as many valid systems
as are possible.

# soln
let the side length of the triangle be `d`

questions

how does electirc potential energy actually work?
- it is defined for the entire configuration 

the way to find the stored potential energy is to do that thing in griffiths 2.31 (b): find the energy required to assemble the configuration - 

- the energy required to assemble the configuration is exactly the same as the pairwise energy 
"total electrostatic potential energy is the sum of the pair energies"


if we take sys = q1 q2 q3 
then 

W = Delta U (sys = q1 q2 q3)    | W = 0 because no external work done, dl = 0, q1 is fixed and so the external force on it doesnt act through a displacement
0 = DKE1 + DKE2 + DKE3 + DUE | we know all KEi = 0 and UEf =0. also KE1f = 0
0 = KE2f + KE3f - UEi | UEi = UEi({1,2}) + UE({2,3}) + UE({1,3}) = 3UEi(1,2) and by symmetry KE2f = KE3f
    = 2KE2f - 3UEi(1,2)
    = 2 * 1/2 m vf^2 - 3 * k q2 / d
m vf2 = 3 k q2 / d
vf = sqrt(3 k q2 / (m d))
