6. Two conducting spheres of radius R1 and R2 are some distance apart from one another and
held fixed. Sphere one initially has a charge Q1i and the second sphere is initially uncharged. The
two spheres are then connected by a long thin wire without changing their positions. After a
sufficient time, find the final charge on each sphere and the potential of each sphere relative to a
zero potential at infinity.

what do we know 

V1f = V2f
Q1i call it Qi 
Qi = Q1f + Q2f 

so since spheres we can do potential V1 = kq/r

k Q1f / R1 = k Q2f / R2
Q1f / R1 = Q2f / R2 
Q1f = Qi - Q2f
Qi - Q2f = R1 Q2f/R2
Qi  = R1 Q2f/R2 + Q2f 
Qi = Q2f(R1/R2 + 1)
Q2f = Qi/(R1/R2 + 1)
    = R2 Qi/(R1+R2)

Q1f = R1 Qi / (R1+R2)

so V1f (thus V2f)
    = (k (R1 Qi)/ (R1+R2)) / R1
    = k Qi / (R1 + R2)

So the potential is proportional to the initial total charge divided by the sum of radii
I wonder how it extends to 3 ballz.

Apparently if the balls are close together then the potential is different than just kq/r
