5. A dielectric sphere of total charge Q and radius R is uniformly charged. Because of Coulomb
repulsion the sphere completely explodes. Find the maximum energy released after all the
sphere’s mass is infinitely far away.

This requires the formula from griffiths 2.4.3 on energy of continuous charge distribution 

W = 1/2 int rho V dtau
